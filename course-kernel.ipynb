The detectors in CERN are **silicon slabs** that are able to detect small changes that correspond to when a particle hits the detector. The detectors are arranged in a manner as shown in the figure below. <br>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/vse3EMh.png\" width=500>\n<br>\nThis gives us an view of how the detectors are arranged in 3 dimensions, which will come in handy when doing visualizations.A very simple analogy to understand the problem:<br>\n\n\n**Consider that we shoot a bullet through multiple vertical cardboard cutouts that are separated horizonatally. Now after the bullet has passed through them we are left with the holes in the cardboard, now our job is to reconstruct the path of the bullet given the holes detected in the cardboard**. \n\nThe following image may provide an intuition behind the problem, where the red dots are the holes left behind and the arc is the possible part of the bullet.\n<br>\n<img src =\"https://i.imgur.com/CJynDG6.png\" >"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"52c109e9d605c283b05383a46d5c262c73911954"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Data\nUpon getting an understanding of the problem, it may be easy to ask, **what is so hard about this?**. A valid question, this brings us to the complexity of the problem and the difficulty in directly throwing any well known ML algorithm without thinking. This is due to the enormous amount of data that is generated and given to us.<br>\nConsider each collision as an **event**. Each **event** creates roughly **10,000** particles. Each particle passes through an average of 10 silicon detectors. On average each **event** has **100,000** data points. The whole dataset has **8,850** events leading to a grand total of **70GB** of training data. \n\n* __Hits__ are given as x, y, z positions and the detector groups they interacted with: volume, layer, module in increasing granularity (volume big, module small). \n* For each hit, we're also also given the __cells__ position and charge that did the detecting.

Given good and reasonable features the approach is typically to use some variant of Clustering to group hits into particles and predict the tracks. The most common kNN clustering is also valid but doens't yield the best results. Typically __DBSCAN__ is the preferred approach for this problem.\n\n### DBSCAN \n**DBSCAN** (Density-Based Spatial Clustering and Application with Noise), is a density-based clusering algorithm, introduced in Ester et al. 1996, which can be used to identify clusters of any shape in a data set containing noise and outliers.\n\nTwo important parameters are required for DBSCAN: \n\n*   epsilon (**eps**) : defines the radius of neighborhood around a point x. It’s called called the ϵ-neighborhood of x. \n*   minimum points (**MinPts**) : the minimum number of neighbors within “eps” radius.\n\nBy default the public DBSCAN benchmark used __eps=0.008__ and achieves an average score of __0.207__. A major task that can be done using ML is using the existing data to make a good guess on the value of __eps__. This improves the clustering and the overall score.\n\n\nBelow is an implementation of a clustering __Class__ that will preprocess the data according to the Angular Track transformation and then proceed to cluster using __DBSCAN__"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"561b19cdb791333ffea4deaa1cb5e9c98594ebca","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nfrom sklearn.cluster import DBSCAN\n\nclass Clusterer(object):\n    \n    def __init__(self, eps):\n        self.eps = eps\n        \n    \n    def _preprocess(self, hits):\n        \n        x = hits.x.values\n        y = hits.y.values\n        z = hits.z.values\n\n        r = np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2 + z**2)\n        hits['x2'] = x/r\n        hits['y2'] = y/r\n\n        r = np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)\n        hits['z2'] = z/r\n\n        ss = StandardScaler()\n        X = ss.fit_transform(hits[['x2', 'y2', 'z2']].values)\n        \n        return X\n    \n    \n    def predict(self, hits):\n        \n        X = self._preprocess(hits)\n        \n        cl = DBSCAN(eps=self.eps, min_samples=1, algorithm='kd_tree')\n        labels = cl.fit_predict(X)\n        \n        return labels\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"e818451d2e4d365e5d44f89c4723103dca6ab133"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Sample clustering of hits of one event "},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"7b310f2011015be550428fa7c4decc0cb07b56bf"},"cell_type":"code","source":"model = Clusterer(eps=0.00715)\nlabels= model.predict(hits)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"77978290c4c5a472c23c8a98e45828b2b8ecfe5b"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# The cluster labels generated \nprint(labels)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d6fd06096a5e542293703edade397dd3fc7e3481"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Function to create a submission "},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"7acefb5cb37372be4dbd51b3cb61e012e157081b"},"cell_type":"code","source":"def create_one_event_submission(event_id, hits, labels):\n    sub_data = np.column_stack(([event_id]*len(hits), hits.hit_id.values, labels))\n    submission = pd.DataFrame(data=sub_data, columns=[\"event_id\", \"hit_id\", \"track_id\"]).astype(int)\n    return submission","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"10c1c0de01fdd74ca49b1af1043e007e3dcc8b8b"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Checking the score of the sample clustering above"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"8182d4975f2a1080f8b760e82089f28ad0daa595"},"cell_type":"code","source":"submission = create_one_event_submission(0, hits, labels)\nscore = score_event(truth, submission)\nprint(\"The score is : \", score)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"033c304704c1e05ad2f8d4a3a8650164db6b6570"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Cross Validating \nChecking the mean score for 5 events that are occur 1000 events after the sample 1st event.\nWe see that we achieve an average score of $\\approx$ __0.2__"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"8c43510b9a1fae952374456736377325b459799a"},"cell_type":"code","source":"dataset_submissions = []\ndataset_scores = []\n\nfor event_id, hits, cells, particles, truth in load_dataset(path_to_train, skip=1000, nevents=5):\n        \n    #

I really loved the __TrackML__ competition, it gave a perspective of domain specific problems that cannot be tackled by simple application of well known ML algorithms. It helped me better understand the value of a good data exploration and visualization using seaborn. These are the most valuable learning that I take away from the course and the competition in general.\n\n__Thank You for reading this long and technical notebook__\n\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/8Tm5jRx.png\">\n<br>"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"f23f550134bb5c7fc111418ff6cc90fa01831070"},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.6","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
